Original colored icons in Inkscape are hard to identify in dark themes. The file "icon.svg" contains bright icons.
To use them in Inkscape, they must be stored in this directory:

~/.config/inkscape/icons/icons.svg


Known issue:
Not all symbols can be customized because Inkscape partly uses standard GTK symbols.
