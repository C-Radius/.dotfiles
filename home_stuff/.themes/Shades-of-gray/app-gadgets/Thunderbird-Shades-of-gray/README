* userChrome.css *
******************

The folder "assets" and the file "userChrome.css" contain a Thunderbird theme adapted to Shades of gray.
Copy both to this location:

~/.thunderbird/<name-of-your-profile>/chrome/userChrome.css
~/.thunderbird/<name-of-your-profile>/chrome/assets

If you change a Shades of gray theme color, you can simply comment out the current theme color in userChrome.css and comment in the new theme color value.

Lightning is using its own colors in default setting. The option for using the theme colors is hidden as "Accessibility". Open the Thunderbird settings and activate the checkbox "Optimize colors for accessibility" in calendar area.
